Without adequate sleep, time in the gym could be, to a large degree, wasted. The repairing of muscle and other tissues, and replacement of aging or dead cells are also important functions of sleep1. If you got seven to eight hours of sleep the night before, you're good to hit the gym. Seven to nine hours of sleep is what most adults need2. However, it's important to note that a lack of sleep increases irritability and risk for anxiety and depression. Physically, a lack of sleep increases the risk for many medical concerns, including type 2 diabetes, high blood pressure, kidney disease, and stroke3. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","It is generally recommended to get 7-9 hours of sleep per night1. If you are working out regularly, it is important to get enough sleep to help your body recover and repair itself after exercise2. You can sleep after gym or before gym depending on your schedule and preference. However, it is recommended to avoid exercising too close to bedtime as it can interfere with sleep3. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions.","Sleeping after a workout is important for muscle recovery and growth. It helps your body repair and rebuild muscle tissue that gets broken down during exercise. It also helps to reduce inflammation and soreness in your muscles. You should aim for at least 7 hours of sleep per night to help your body recover from your workouts1. I hope that helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],

Most gyms are busiest in the mid to late morning (right before people head off to work), around 8 to 10 am, and in the evening (right after work) from around 4 to 7 pm2. If you want to avoid crowds, you can try going during the work day or late in the evening2. I hope this helps! Let me know if you have any other questions."],
